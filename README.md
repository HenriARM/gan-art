# TO RUN

1. create folders images and models


pyenv installed in ~/.pyenv
all python versions installed into ~/.pyenv/versions
check bash_profile, since all python aliases and paths are there

for now when calling python 3.7 and its inside installed pip, just write "python" and "pip"

Virtual Environments
python -m venv env

pip freeze # to print all installed libraries, there ones which were needed for other library also printed
